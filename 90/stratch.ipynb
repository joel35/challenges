You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.\\n\"\\n1,2,Officer Barbrady,\"No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"Where is she?\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I\\'m looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!\\n\"\\n1,2,Kyle,\"I don\\'t think they\\'re going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"You guys, we have to stop him!\\n\"\\n1,2,Kyle,\"Stop who?\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"Mr. Garrison. He\\'s going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"Oh no you don\\'t, you\\'re not going to ruin my moment of fame.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"He\\'s got a gun!\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There\\'s something more important right now. Let\\'s go!\\n\"\\n1,2,Stan,\"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What\\'s more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"Stan, I can\\'t do it alone. Please? \\n\"\\n1,2,Kyle,\"Uh oh, we\\'re losing him. \\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"Here she comes. \\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"Damn, I guess I\\'m not the only person in America who\\'s thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.\\n\"\\n1,2,Townswoman,\"We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh\\n\"\\n1,2,Kathie Lee,\"I love you, too.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"Come on you little bitch.  You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"It is with great pride and honor that I\\'d like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.\\n\"\\n1,2,Chef,\"Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don\\'t mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.\\nOh, Kathie Lee, how I\\'d love to lay you down.\\nAnd lick every inch of your body with my tongue.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"What?\\n\"\\n1,2,Chef,\"Kathie Lee, you\\'re my sexual fantasy.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"What? Oh God!\\n\"\\n1,2,Chef,\"How \\'bout you and me-\\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.\\n\"\\n1,2,Chef,\"-get together and make... sweet... love?\\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"Thank you Chef! \\n\"\\n1,2,Chef,\"Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!\\n\"\\n1,2,Officer Barbrady,\"What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. \\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.\\n\"\\n1,2,Officer Barbrady,\"Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...\\n\"\\n1,2,Officer Barbrady,\"Damn, he could be anywhere! I\\'ll send out an APB!\\n\"\\n1,2,Stan,\"Wendy, look! \\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman...\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"Cartman, God damn it.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"...is your favorite celebrity, and mine  Kathie Lee Gifford! \\n\"\\n1,2,Kathie Lee,\"Thank you. And I love you all.\\n\"\\n1,2,Stan,\"Mr. Garrison, stop!\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"I know that she\\'s hurt you. She\\'s hurt a lot of people.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"You can\\'t know.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"You should have won that talent show.\\n\"\\n1,2,Kathie Lee,\"It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"Here it is, my big moment of fame.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn\\'t the answer.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"It is, too late for me, young Wendy.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"You see, I\\'ve learned something today. You can\\'t win all the time. And if you don\\'t win, you certainly can\\'t hold it against the person who did, because that\\'s the only way you ever really lose.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"You... you\\'re right.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"Gooood.\\n\"\\n1,2,Stan,\"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Hat,\"The bitch must die!\\n\"\\n1,2,Kathie Lee,\"Ooohhhh! \\n\"\\n1,2,Kenny,\"(Oh no!) \\n\"\\n1,2,Kyle,\"Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! \\n\"\\n1,2,Agent 1,\"Gun!\\n\"\\n1,2,Agent 2,\"Gun!\\n\"\\n1,2,Kyle,\"Hey, come back! We didn\\'t even get to do our play. \\n\"\\n1,2,TV Crew Director,\"I guess that\\'s it, guys. Wrap it up.\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?\\n\"\\n1,2,TV Crew Director,\"Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"But I won the environmental essay contest.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"You don\\'t deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I\\'m holding Cartman\\'s award winning paper. It\\'s actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau\\'s name crossed out, and Cartman\\'s name written in its place.\\n\"\\n1,2,Townsman 1,\"Who cares?\\n\"\\n1,2,Townsman 2,\"Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford\\'s gone.\\n\"\\n1,2,Stan,\"Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"Well, not if it\\'s Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don\\'t even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you\\'d all know what it was.\\n\"\\n1,2,Stan,\"Come on Wendy, Kyle\\'s mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.\\n\"\\n1,2,Wendy,\"Ah, what the hell. \\n\"\\n1,2,Mayor,\"Nohoho nooo. Now I\\'ll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!\\n\"\\n1,2,Aide 1,\"Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.\\n\"\\n1,2,Officer Barbrady,\"Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Hat,\"Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren\\'t for those meddling kids.\\n\"\\n1,2,Officer Barbrady,\"You\\'re lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt. \\n\"\\n1,2,Stan,\"We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"Well children, I\\'d love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Hat,\"We can still get her! Let mmm--\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"I\\'m just so sorry that I ruined everyone\\'s chances for being on TV.\\n\"\\n1,2,Kyle,\"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.\\n\"\\n1,2,Mr. Garrison,\"Really, on what?\\n\"\\n1,2,Geraldo,\"Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can\\'t even get out of his house.\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"When is this going to be on the air?\\n\"\\n1,2,Geraldo,\"Is there anything you\\'d like to say to people out there?\\n\"\\n1,2,Cartman,\"Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I\\'m living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!\\n\"\\n1,2,Chef,\"He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.\\n\"\\n1,2,Kathie Lee,\"Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin\\' Chef?\\n\"\\n1,2,Chef,\"Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?\\n\"\\n1,3,Liane,\"Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Okay, Mom.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"That\\'s right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.\\n\"\\n1,3,Liane,\"Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Don\\'t worry Mrs. Cartman, we\\'ll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?\\n\"\\n1,3,Liane,\"Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don\\'t wipe with poison ivy. \\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Dude, that\\'s sick mom.\\n\"\\n1,3,Liane,\"And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy\\'s not far away. \\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Drive, Drive!\\n\"\\n1,3,Liane,\"You give your mommy a kissy.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Drive the car damn-it, drive!\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Don\\'t get scared up in the mountains Cartman.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Shut up, I\\'m not scared of nothing.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kenny,\"(Maybe she\\'ll suck my dick)\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Oh, ho, that\\'s disgusting.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"You piece of crap, I\\'ll kill you! \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"That\\'s the spirit boys, let\\'s get that testosterone flowin\\'.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Eeeh!  \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don\\'t ever walk with your gun unless the safety\\'s on. Second, don\\'t shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don\\'t drink beer.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"You what?!?\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Moh Yeah, that\\'s right, I don\\'t think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"I like chocolate milk.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Well, we\\'ll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young \\'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey, I didn\\'t get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in \\'Nam\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"You weren\\'t in Vietnam, Cartman.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Were you stationed in De Nang?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can\\'t believe anything he says.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey, I\\'ll blow your friggin\\' head off.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Hey, look out son, that\\'s dangerous. You\\'re gonna spill your beer.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he\\'s gonna take me hunting in Africa.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Wow, that\\'d be cool.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"My mom says there\\'s a lot of black people in Africa.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Boys, looky there. That there\\'s a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn\\'t it beautiful… By God, it\\'s coming right for us! \\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Hey, it wasn\\'t coming right for us. It was just sitting there.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Shhh, not so loud. Now that there\\'s just a technicality.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"What do you mean?\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Democrats piss me off!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"They say we can\\'t shoot certain animals anymore, unless they\\'re posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin\\', we have to say \\'It\\'s coming right for us.\\'\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Wow, you\\'re smart Uncle Jimbo.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Ohho, it\\'s a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It\\'s coming right for us!  \\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Kickass!! \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o\\'clock. \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Let\\'s move, moove! \\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Is this hunting?\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"I guess so.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Ah, dude! I\\'m starting to have flashbacks.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"What?!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"This one\\'s yours Stan.  It\\'s coming right for us.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"It\\'s coming right for us. \\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Shoot it Stan.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"I got your back, soldier.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"I can\\'t. \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"What the? What\\'s wrong with you?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"I don\\'t want to shoot the bunny.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"What the hell are you talking about, you don\\'t want to shoot the bunny? You\\'re babbling, you\\'re not making any sense, you\\'re hysterical.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"I\\'m not hysterical, I just don\\'t want to shoot the bunny.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can\\'t shoot anything.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"I can shoot you, fat ass!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"I can shoot you too!\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"I\\'ll kill you!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"I\\'ll fill you full of lead!\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Hey, what\\'s that?\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it\\'s uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle\\'s moving. Yeah, it\\'s going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it\\'s smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! \\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"My weenies won\\'t cook.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, this wood won\\'t burn, umm.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Well, Ned, looks like we\\'ll have to use the old Indian fire trick.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, yepper.  Mmm, aahh, oh.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!! \\n\"\\n1,3,\"Stan, Kyle\",\"Whoa!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.\\n\"\\n1,3,Chef,\"But you see Mr. Mayor, you can\\'t stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What\\'s next, meatloaf?\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but… \\n\"\\n1,3,Johnson,\"Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don\\'t need another check-up.\\n\"\\n1,3,Johnson,\"No mayor, that\\'s a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Don\\'t you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God\\'s sake! You get out of my office!\\n\"\\n1,3,Johnson,\"I\\'m not in your office mayor, I\\'m talking to you through a speaker.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Just send in the geometrist.\\n\"\\n1,3,Johnson,\"Geologist…\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"You are fired, buddy!\\n\"\\n1,3,Johnson,\"Thank you mayor, it\\'s been great working for you.\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"What does this mean to the town?\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"My God!\\n\"\\n1,3,Chef,\"Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? \\n\"\\n1,3,Ted,\"Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I\\'m his replacement, Ted.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don\\'t worry, things are under control.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it\\'s still crawling around to this day.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmmowwwh. \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Hah, got ya.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Heh, that\\'s not scary.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Shut up, I didn\\'t pee in my pants!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Yeah, Cartman\\'s pee.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey, you would taste my pee!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"What the hell\\'s wrong with you? Can\\'t you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Hey, I\\'m a dirty little bastard too.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey you guys. I know a scary story.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Shut up, Cartman! You can\\'t scare anybody!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Whatabutt?\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Why?\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Deformed how?\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"A hook.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"A knife.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"No! A piece of celery.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Celery?\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there\\'s nothing but…Patrick Duffy.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that\\'s not scary!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Yeah, give me that flashlight. \\n\"\\n1,3,Kenny,\"(Hey, what\\'s that?)\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"What is that?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Maybe it\\'s Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey, it might be!\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Gosh, I hope he doesn\\'t cut me with his celery hand. \\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Hey Ned, why don\\'t you whip out the ol\\' cancer kazoo? Let\\'s do a little song.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.\\nKumbayah my lord, kumbayah. \\nUumbayah my lord, kumbayah. \\nMoh lord, Kumbayah.\\nEmsomeone\\'s crying my lord, Kumbayah\\nSomeone\\'s crying my lord, Kumbayah...\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"They don\\'t think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let\\'s see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I\\'ll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"… Someone\\'s crying my lord, Kumbayah.\\nMoh lord, Kumbayah.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Stan, Stan, wake up!\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"What, dude?\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"I don\\'t know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Where\\'s my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"They\\'re out fishing with Kenny.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn\\'t he like me anymore?\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"What? \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"What a beautiful morning for fishing. There\\'s one, there\\'s a fish right there! \\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, got it. \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Great instincts boy.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman\\'s missing!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Who? The fat kid?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Yeah.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that\\'s about the limit for our fishing permit.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Moh man it smells like dead fish here.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kenny,\"(A little like a vagina.)\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Em-moh man, that is nasty.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Heh, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I\\'m making you... my honorary nephew.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kenny,\"(Thanks.) \\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking timebomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.\\n\"\\n1,3,Crowd,\"Yeahhh. \\n\"\\n1,3,Individual in crowd,\"Hey, I\\'m on TV! I\\'m on TV!\\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I\\'m sorry, can I start over?\\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"Huh?\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can\\'t do anything until we get them. Okay people, let\\'s go get those kids.\\n\"\\n1,3,Chef,\"Come on everybody. You got to help the children.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Uh, well, he couldn\\'t have gone far, unless something drug him off.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"There\\'s not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Yeah, it\\'s almost like something funny\\'s going on.  Christ, Ned, what\\'d you have for breakfast.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mm I don\\'t know man. I\\'ve got some bad gas.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Wait, there\\'s a ram! It\\'s coming right for us!  Nice shootin\\' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Look!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, what is it?\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Dude, it\\'s Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn\\'t lying.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"We\\'ll be on the cover of Guns & Ammo.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"This calls for some HJ-14.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Heheh.

Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"Mayor, I might have an idea.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Huh, what?\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"And, that would be good? Alright?\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"Uh - pretty sure.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I\\'ll bet that sucker\\'s headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Look, up there.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"You guys, it\\'s just me.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Are we sure it\\'s Scuzzlebutt?\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"I can\\'t tell; let\\'s kill it!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Kenny, you take the front.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"That\\'s the spirit, kiddo. Let\\'s hunt!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!\\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.\\n\"\\n1,3,Officer Barbrady,\"Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. \\n\"\\n1,3,Host,\"Harbringers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It\\'s a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.  That\\'s right Jane, duck and cover.  So what will you-do when you hear a volcano erupting?  That\\'s right, duck and cover.  Looks like you got the idea.Thank you and goodbye.\\n\"\\n1,3,Officer Barbrady,\"OK, any questions?\\n\"\\n1,3,Chef,\"That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!\\n\"\\n1,3,Officer Barbrady,\"That\\'s enough out of you!\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"I\\'m gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we\\'ll see who\\'s the little bastard.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey, seriously you guys!\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Ah, damn it, I can\\'t do it!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"You pansy! give me that gun.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Hey!\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Cartman?\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Goddammit, don\\'t shoot me!\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"What in Sam Hell?\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, so much for the cover of Guns & Ammo.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Yepper, but I think we\\'ve learned some important lessons Ned I think that- \\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Whoa!\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmm, holy crap.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"The mountain! It\\'s blown it\\'s top! \\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!\\n\"\\n1,3,Kenny,\"(Nope, I\\'m okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)

We can\\'t get across!\\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Help! \\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Jimminy Hope, it\\'s the real Scuzzlebutt!\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"What?! Scuzzlebutt\\'s real?!\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Oh my God! Look at his leg!\\n\"\\n1,3,Patrick Duffy,\"Hi kids, I\\'m TV\\'s Patrick Duffy.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Quick Ned, shoot it!\\n\"\\n1,3,Ned,\"Mmmoh no, out of ammo.\\n\"\\n1,3,Scuzzlebutt,\"Grrrr.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"What... is that thing?\\n\"\\n1,3,Chef,\"That\\'s Scuzzlebutt.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mr. Garrison,\"Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.\\n\"\\n1,3,Officer Barbrady,\"This isn\\'t happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Well boys, I\\'m sorry I got you all killed. \\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Aaaaah! \\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Whoa, he built a wicker basket\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"Hey, he\\'s saving us.\\n\"\\n1,3,Scuzzlebutt,\"Grrr.\\n\"\\n1,3,Liane,\"Scuzzlebutt saved the day.\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?\\n\"\\n1,3,Randy,\"Uhh...\\n\"\\n1,3,Denver citizens,\"Aaaaah.\\n\"\\n1,3,Mr. Garrison,\"South Park is saved. \\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Hey look, Kenny\\'s okay.\\n\"\\n1,3,Kenny,\"(Hey guys, come here.)\\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I\\'m getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.\\n\"\\n1,3,Chef,\"Mmmm\\nBaby, every time that we kiss\\nHot Lava!\\nEvery time that we make love, hot lava\\nHot Lava!\\nLava so hot it makes me sweat\\nLava so warm and red and wet\\nLava!\\nBrrrrrrrrrrrr.\\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?\\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.\\n\"\\n1,3,Scuzzlebutt,\"Friend. \\n\"\\n1,3,Mayor,\"Oh, how sweet.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. \\n\"\\n1,3,Newscaster,\"Oh my God!

Mmm, I\\'ll never use a gun again, mmm. \\n\"\\n1,3,Kenny,\"(Oh, no!) \\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.\\n\"\\n1,3,Jimbo,\"But Kenny\\'s dead now, Stan, and you\\'re always going to be my nephew. And you can\\'t just kill anything. You understand?\\n\"\\n1,3,Kyle,\"Dude, I don\\'t understand hunting at all.\\n\"\\n1,3,Stan,\"Yeah,  it\\'s stupid. Let\\'s go watch cartoons.\\n\"\\n1,3,Cartman,\"Yeah, cartoons kick ass! \\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Hey, where\\'s the school bus?

That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can\\'t always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let\\'s start practice. \\n\"\\n1,4,Pip,\"Uh, Mr. Chef sir?\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"Yes Pip, what is it?\\n\"\\n1,4,Pip,\"Well, I still don\\'t have a helmet.\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"I know Pip, the school can\\'t afford helmets for everybody.\\n\"\\n1,4,Pip,\"Yes, but, couldn\\'t we rotate who doesn\\'t have a helmet every week?

Sit down.  Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"I guess.\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"Good, I\\'m glad we could have this little talk Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.\\n\"\\n1,4,Cartman,\"You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"You\\'re gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.\\n\"\\n1,4,Cartman,\"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan\\'s little homo dog.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Shut up dude!

I have to find my dog. \\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Come on Ned, and keep quiet.\\n\"\\n1,4,Ned,\"Okay \\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Hello there, Enrique.\\n\"\\n1,4,Ned,\"What are we doing here?\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Well Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park\\'s mascot. But this year we\\'re gonna booby-trap it instead.  And when John Stamos\\' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom!  No more Middle Park players. \\n\"\\n1,4,Ned,\"Hahahahaha. Hahahahaha.\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"God damn, I love football!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?\\n\"\\n1,4,Cowboys,\"Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank Hammond,\"Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight\\'s match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows.  Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up.\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"Oohh, come on Stan.\\n\"\\n1,4,Pip,\"Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn\\'t show up, can I use his helmet?\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"No Pip, I\\'m sorry!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Sparky! Sparky!\\n\"\\n1,4,Referee,\"Play ball.\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"You\\'re gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"But I never practiced quarterback.\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"It\\'s a little late for that bullcrap now.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broflovski.\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"Heyhey, where is little Stanley?\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Hat,\"Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Ned, look.  They\\'ve got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb\\'s still attached.\\n\"\\n1,4,Ned,\"Yay.\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Hi little fella, how are you doing today?\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Fine, how are you?\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"I\\'m super, thanks for asking.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Well, let\\'s see. Come on in. Hmm. \\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"D\\'you have lots of gay dogs here?\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al\\'s. Over here we have a gay lion. \\n\"\\n1,4,Gay Lion,\"Rooaar\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here\\'s a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it\\'s so super to see you!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Of course they are, silly buns. It\\'s the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Would you like to dance? \\n\"\\n1,4,Vocalist,\"Oww, we can both be gay!\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I\\'ll throw it at something. Ready?!\\n\"\\n1,4,Huddle,\"Break!\\n\"\\n1,4,Cowboy 1,\"You guys are toast.\\n\"\\n1,4,Cowboy 2,\"Yeah, we\\'re gonna pound your heads in.\\n\"\\n1,4,Cartman,\"We\\'ll just see about that.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"What\\'s the matter?\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Cartman farted!\\n\"\\n1,4,Cartman,\"No I didn\\'t. That was just my shoes.\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"Come on, Cows. We\\'ll get a delay of game penalty.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"No way dude!\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"Hike the ball.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Ah, dude, weak.\\n\"\\n1,4,Cartman,\"That\\'s right, you get back there.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Hut.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"The ball is snapped. Middle Park blitzes.  Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. they run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter.\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Hell\\'s bells.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Why, I haven\\'t seen a beating like that since Rodney King.\\n\"\\n1,4,Phil,\"Now Frank, that\\'s not very PC. You\\'re gonna get us in trouble again.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that.\\n\"\\n1,4,Townsman 1,\"We lose our money \\'cause of your nephew, we\\'re gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo.\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Don\\'t y\\'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.\\n\"\\n1,4,Vocalist,\"...both be gay.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how\\'s it goin\\'?\\n\"\\n1,4,Sparky,\"Ruff.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.\\n\"\\n1,4,Sparky,\"Barr.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Come on, let\\'s go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Young man, it appears you still don\\'t understand.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"What don\\'t I understand?\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Come this way, I have to show you something.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Hut, hut. \\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Oh no, I haven\\'t seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant.\\n\"\\n1,4,Phil,\"Dude! Now that is not cool.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Sorry, sorry.\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.  Step aboard, Stanley.  Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure we\\'ll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"And the South Park Cows are set to receive...  There\\'s the kick. It\\'s taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick.  He\\'s at the 50, the 40, the 30.\\n\"\\n1,4,Cowboys,\"Hold him, hold him!  Hold him, hold him!\\n\"\\n1,4,Cowboy,\"Yaaah! \\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"The running back is down. I think he\\'s...  Yes, he\\'s been decapitated.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!\\n\"\\n1,4,Phil,\"That\\'s gotta hurt, Frank.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"How terue!\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Looks like the South Park Cows aren\\'t even gonna beat the 72 point spread. Not by a long shot.\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan.  Uh oh, look out, it\\'s the oppressors. Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!  Ohhh! Oh God, that was close. Okay, let\\'s steer our Big Gay Boat out of here and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely. \\n\"\\n1,4,Boat Ride Singers,\"We\\'re all gay, and it\\'s okay\\n\\'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.\\nWe\\'re not sad anymore, cause we\\'re out the closet door.\\nIt\\'s okay, hey, to be gay!\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Sooo, what do you think Stan? \\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"This kicks ass! I\\'m sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn\\'t understand. \\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Isn\\'t this precious?\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"And now, here to sing the touching song, Loving You is the one and only, John Stamos\\' brother...\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Alright Richard!\\n\"\\n1,4,Richard,\"Loving you\\nis easy cause you\\'re beautiful\\n-doo-n-doo--doo-doooo--\\nAaaaa! \\nAaaaa!\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"What the hell?!\\n\"\\n1,4,Richard,\"Aaaaa! \\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"He didn\\'t sing the high F.\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"Richard Stamos can\\'t sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Ned, we are going to get our asses kicked.\\n\"\\n1,4,Richard,\"Lalalalala...\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"It\\'s obvious where all the talent in that family went!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!\\n\"\\n1,4,Sparky,\"Ruff!\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"No problem kids. Are you sure you don\\'t wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"No thanks, I\\'ve gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! \\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Oh Stan?  When you get back to town,  tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"I will Big Gay Al, I will. \\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"Ooh, my carrot cake! \\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Hike!\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven\\'t seen so many children molested since...\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing Jimbo.\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Hat,\"Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.\\n\"\\n1,4,Townsman,\"You\\'re a dead man Jimbo \\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Well, this should just about wrap it up for-  Wait a minute, what\\'s this?\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Yeah!!!\\n\"\\n1,4,Crowd Member,\"Yohooooh.\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"It\\'s Stan, the South Park star quarterback!\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"Where the hell have you been Stan?!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"I\\'ve been getting my best friend back.\\n\"\\n1,4,Chef,\"Just get in there boy!\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Give \\'em hell Stanley!  Jesus, now I haven\\'t asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?\\n\"\\n1,4,Jesus,\"Leave me alone.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Hike!\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Hey Stan, Ah- I\\'m open, I think.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Mph. \\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid.\\n\"\\n1,4,Kyle,\"Oof. \\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Oh my! I haven\\'t seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!\\n\"\\n1,4,Phil,\"Dude! \\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Touchdown!\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Yeah!\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"Wooo!\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread! \\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"Yeah! Woohoo!\\n\"\\n1,4,Townsman,\"Speech!\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Uh. It, it\\'s really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.\\n\"\\n1,4,Crowd,\"Yeah, alright!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"And maybe - we can beat \\'em even more next year!\\n\"\\n1,4,Crowd,\"Woooo!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"And it\\'s okay to be gay! \\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"What?!\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"What the hell is he talking about?!\\n\"\\n1,4,Frank,\"Uhh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It\\'s true, I\\'ll show you.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.\\n\"\\n1,4,Cartman,\"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I\\'m worried about you man. \\n\"\\n1,4,Townswoman,\"Oliver, I thought you ran away all those months ago.\\n\"\\n1,4,Townsperson 1,\"Sidney!\\n\"\\n1,4,Townsperson 2,\"Willy!\\n\"\\n1,4,Townsperson 3,\"Carlos!\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.\\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Oh, there you are dude. How\\'s it going?\\n\"\\n1,4,Big Gay Al,\"I\\'m super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.  Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you. \\n\"\\n1,4,Stan,\"Wow! \\n\"\\n1,4,Richard,\"You guys, you guys! I can do it.\\n\"\\n1,4,Mr. Garrison,\"Do what?\\n\"\\n1,4,Richard,\"Loving you\\nis easy cause you\\'re beautiful\\ndoo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo\\n\"\\n1,4,Jimbo,\"No!\\n\"\\n1,4,Richard,\"Aaah\\n\"\\n1,4,Enrique,\"Mroo- \\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Hey Stan, where\\'d you get that black eye?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Your sister beat you up again, huh?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"No!\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"She\\'s just pissed off \\'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She\\'s taking it out on me.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I\\'d be like, \"\"hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!\"\"\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"My parents don\\'t even believe that she beats me up.  They think she\\'s all innocent and sweet, but I know that she\\'s an evil bitch!\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Be a man Stan.  Just say, \"\"Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies.\"\"\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Hey Kyle, what\\'s that elephant doing?\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"You mean this one?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Yeah.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"He\\'s my new pet elephant.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Whoa dude!  Where\\'d you get a pet elephant?\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Wow, that\\'s cool!\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"No it\\'s not cool!  My mom won\\'t let me keep him in the house.  She says he\\'s too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"That\\'s why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kenny,\"(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they\\'re almost the same.)\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Well yeah, but pigs aren\\'t smart, like elephants.\\n\"\\n1,5,Ms. Crabtree,\"Hey.  Wait a minute.  What is that thing?\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.\\n\"\\n1,5,Ms. Crabtree,\"Oh—I\\'m sorry little girl.  But you still can\\'t get on.  You have to take the special ed bus.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Boy, it looks like you\\'re not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. \\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"If a woman ever gave me crap, I\\'d say, \"\"Hey, you go do my laundry and-\"\"\\n\"\\n1,5,Ms. Crabtree,\"SIT DOWN KID!!!\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Yes ma\\'am.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Hat,\"That\\'s right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science.  You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Mr. Garrison?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"Yes Kyle.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"That\\'s it.  I\\'m going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They\\'d be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"That\\'d be cool!\\n\"\\n1,5,Bebe,\"I want a pot-bellied elephant.\\n\"\\n1,5,Pip,\"Yes, I\\'ll pay fifty dollars for one.\\n\"\\n1,5,Terrance,\"That\\'s stupid.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.\\n\"\\n1,5,Terrance,\"Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"I\\'ll bet you can\\'t.\\n\"\\n1,5,Terrance,\"Watch me plebeian.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie.  Isn\\'t this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Hat,\"Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God\\'s horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. \\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"We can use Cartman\\'s pig.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"We\\'re not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"You\\'re not using any of Fluffy\\'s blood, or else I\\'ll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! \\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Okay.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"I couldn\\'t help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Yes…\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"Oh dear.  Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it. \\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Hat,\"I\\'m your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan.  You can tell me anything.  Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Oh, neither.  It\\'s my sister.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"Your sister?!  Oh for Pete\\'s sake, don\\'t be such a little wuss.  Stop wasting Mr. Hat\\'s time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!\\n\"\\n1,5,Jesus,\"Let\\'s open the phone lines back up for some questions….\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"Hey!\\n\"\\n1,5,Robert,\"Yeah, is this Jesus?\\n\"\\n1,5,Jesus,\"Yes, my son.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Hi Shelly.\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"Are you looking at my headgear?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Headgear?  What headgear?\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"Are you looking at my headgear?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn\\'t really notice.\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"You little liar. \\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! \\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Ready to go Stan?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Go where?\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"We got Cartman\\'s pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant\\'s.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Nobody\\'s splicin\\' nothing from Fluffy!\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"I swear I\\'m gonna kill you Stan!\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Why\\'s your sister so mean to you dude?\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I\\'d be all like, \"\"Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don\\'t you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!\"\"\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"Who said that? \\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"This must be it. \\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Well, looks like nobody\\'s home.  Guess we should come back some other time.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"No, Cartman, we\\'re going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"It\\'s okay Fluffy, I won\\'t let them hurt you.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"It\\'s just a stupid pig.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Yeah, quit being such a baby.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Baby?!  Well, at least I don\\'t get my ass kicked by a girl!\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"At least I\\'m not a little pigfucker!\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Hey!  I\\'m taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I\\'m going home!  This whole idea\\'s stupid anyway.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a \\'D\\'!\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Hey!  Why don\\'t you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"There\\'s no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"I\\'ll kick you in the nuts!\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Can I help you? \\n\"\\n1,5,Kenny,\"Mmmmmm! \\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Ohh, that\\'s an even better idea.  Come on in.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"I\\'m so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Eh, it\\'s okay Fluffy, nobody\\'s going to hurt you.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"It\\'s thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war.  I have created things that will change the world for the better.  For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.\\n\"\\n1,5,Monkey,\"Mhhh.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"How does that make the world better?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich.  And my four assed mongoose.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Oh, uh, I suppose so uh.  Oh yes, over here.  Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Oh.  Well I\\'m sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won\\'t splice.  Haven\\'t you ever heard that song by \\'Loverboy\\'?\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Which song is that?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won\\'t splice!  Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"You can keep your hands off of Fluffy\\'s ass!\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"You know, it\\'s amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days. \\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Ow!\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Hmm?  What?  Oh, excuse me.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Wait, what are you taking Stan\\'s blood for?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"Oh, pardon me, I tripped.  Could I have some hair please?\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Watch out Stan!

Children, we could make a fortune with this.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"You hear that dudes? We\\'ll be rich!\\n\"\\n1,5,Chef,\"Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge.

No fuckin\\' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Crap.\\n\"\\n1,5,TV Voice,\"And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access…\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"Are you staring at my neckbrace?\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you\\'re my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I\\'m gonna be bigger than you, and you\\'re gonna wish you\\'d never done any of this to me.\\n\"\\n1,5,Shelly,\"You\\'ll never be bigger than me Stan.

Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there\\'s nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Hey, how do we know if she\\'s pregnant?\\n\"\\n1,5,Chef,\"Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.\\n\"\\n1,5,Cartman,\"Well, good job Einstein, why don\\'t we just build a rocket in the meantime?

I\\'m afraid there\\'s been a bit of an incident at the ranch.  You see, I\\'ve created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he\\'s broken free.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kenny,\"(A big mutant Stan?!)\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"A big mutant version of me?\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Is he bigger than a regular clone?\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"He\\'s terribly dangerous.

Back to you in the studio.\\n\"\\n1,5,TV Newscaster,\"Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body.

Boys, I\\'m lusciously sorry for everything.\\n\"\\n1,5,Terrance,\"Hey, they\\'ve got our clone.  He belongs to us.\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere.  Boys, I\\'m sorry I\\'ve caused you such - inconvenience.  I tried to play God, and I failed. \\n\"\\n1,5,Terrance,\"Daddy! Nooooo!\\n\"\\n1,5,Mephesto,\"All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed.  Perhaps we shouldn\\'t be toying with God\\'s creations.  Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.\\n\"\\n1,5,Terrance,\"You cheating bastards.  This isn\\'t over, just wait until tomorrow.\\n\"\\n1,5,Kyle,\"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!\\n\"\\n1,5,Stan,\"Mom and dad are home.

And yet, you\\'ve done so much more than that.  Today you\\'ve taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don\\'t always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. \\n\"\\n1,5,Mr. Garrison,\"Everyone, let\\'s give K.

What the hell was that for?!\\n\"\\n1,6,Cartman,\"That\\'s for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!\\n\"\\n1,6,Clyde,\"Yeah, what\\'s the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?\\n\"\\n1,6,Kyle,\"Well I didn\\'t have her do it. She did it on her own.\\n\"\\n1,6,Cartman,\"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle\\'s mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!\\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Garrison,\"Children! Children! A certain student\\'s mother called me last night.\\n\"\\n1,6,Cartman,\"Oh, gee, I wonder who\\'s mother that could have been?\\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Garrison,\"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.\\n\"\\n1,6,Class,\"Yeahh, woohoo!\\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Hat,\"Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.\\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Garrison,\"That\\'s right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call \\'toilet humor.\\' They don\\'t expand your minds.  You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.  Kenny, why are you late to class?  Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.  Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...  Yes Kenny, what is it?\\n\"\\n1,6,Kenny,\"(I have to go pee.)\\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Garrison,\"I thought you just came from the bathroom.\\n\"\\n1,6,Kenny,\"(I did, I gotta go again...)\\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Garrison,\"Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn\\'t based in reality. There\\'s much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. \\n\"\\n1,6,Stan,\"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!\\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Garrison,\"Pay attention children!  I\\'m going to join your parents in requesting that you don\\'t watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.\\n\"\\n1,6,Cartman,\"What?\\n\"\\n1,6,Clyde,\"Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever? \\n\"\\n1,6,Mr. Garrison,\"That\\'s right children. Are there any questions?

You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Did you guys see that?

Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I\\'m Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Hey, who\\'s that fat chick?\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Oh.\\n\"\\n1,8,Sally Struthers,\"You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Doesn\\'t look like she\\'s having any trouble finding food.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Yeah, she\\'s fatter than Cartman.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Yeah, HEY!\\n\"\\n1,8,Sally Struthers,\"For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"That\\'s stupid, who the hell would want to do that?\\n\"\\n1,8,Sally Struthers,\"Sponsor now and we\\'ll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"KICK ASS!!\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"SWEET!\\n\"\\n1,8,Kenny,\"(Woohoo!)\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"I\\'ll call.

She says we do.\\n\"\\n1,8,All,\"Cool.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"I get to wear it first, you guys.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"I can\\'t wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Children, children! To honor this special time of year we\\'ll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"When they cut up a chick\\'s stomach to get a baby out?\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Noo, that\\'s a Caesarian Section Eric, but that\\'s okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.  A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can\\'t afford to eat on Thanksgiving.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"You mean, like Kenny?\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Exactly.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"I don\\'t know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny\\'s family and other poor people.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"I\\'m not bringin\\' in food for poor people, Screw them!\\n\"\\n1,8,Wendy,\"Don\\'t you want to help those who are less fortunate?!\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!\\n\"\\n1,8,Wendy,\"This is the one time of year you\\'re supposed to care about people who can\\'t eat!\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Isn\\'t it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!\\n\"\\n1,8,Wendy,\"Many would rather die than go to those places!\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Okay kids, that\\'s enough Dickens for one day. Let\\'s get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Hat,\"That\\'s right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?\\n\"\\n1,8,Clyde,\"Aaaah!\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"What the hell is going on?! \\n\"\\n1,8,Clyde,\"Aaaah!\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Well, you don\\'t see that everyday.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we\\'ll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor.\\n\"\\n1,8,Aide 2,\"It should be something festive.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Mayor, we\\'ve got a very big problem.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Ahh, you\\'re that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Uh huh.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"You know, to provide food for the needy.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Of course. \\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they\\'re REALLY pissed off.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Naturally.  Oh, do go on.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"You were saying?\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"They act just like normal turkeys, except they\\'re evil.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Oh, my! \\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Somehow I don\\'t think you\\'re taking me seriously.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Uh now why would you say that?\\n\"\\n1,8,Everybody,\"Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?\\n\"\\n1,8,Liane,\"Not yet hon.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Damn.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Hey, look you guys.\\n\"\\n1,8,TV Announcer,\"And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special .\\n\"\\n1,8,Terrance,\"I sure am cold, Phillip.\\n\"\\n1,8,Phillip,\"Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.\\n\"\\n1,8,Terrance,\"Gosh, I hope we don\\'t starve.\\n\"\\n1,8,Phillip,\"Ah, a squeaker!\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"The digital sports watch is here.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"What the hell?\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Dude, that\\'s not a digital sports watch.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"What\\'s your name dude?\\n\"\\n1,8,Kid,\"Mabin.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"I think he said his name is Marvin.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Yeah, Starvin\\' Marvin.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Nice to meet you Starvin\\' Marvin.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Hey mooom?\\n\"\\n1,8,Liane,\"Yes hon?\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?\\n\"\\n1,8,Liane,\"Sure, hon.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Sweet. \\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Dude, let\\'s bring him to school tomorrow.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Come on Starvin\\' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"No no! He\\'s my son! I adopted him.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"It was my mom\\'s credit card.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Okay, okay, wewe\\'ll switch off. Starvin\\' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan\\'s, then with me.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Totally. \\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Ahh!\\n\"\\n1,8,Woman,\"Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It\\'s so beautiful.\\n\"\\n1,8,Man,\"Not as beautiful as you.\\n\"\\n1,8,Woman,\"Ooooh. \\n\"\\n1,8,Man,\"Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.\\n\"\\n1,8,Woman,\"Oohh, they\\'re so beautiful.\\n\"\\n1,8,Man,\"Not as beautiful as you.\\n\"\\n1,8,Woman,\"Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.\\n\"\\n1,8,Man,\"Not as beautiful as- \\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin\\' Marvin. This is what we call an \\'all you can eat buffet.\\'\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That\\'s why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny\\'s family \\'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin\\' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin\\' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.\\n\"\\n1,8,Marvin,\"Ap-ee-tizer.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that\\'s it for the appetizers. \\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"No Starvin\\' Marvin, that\\'s my pot-pie.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you\\'re supposed to share.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Oh yeah, you\\'re right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don\\'t want all that, why don\\'t you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Children, children! I\\'m a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.  And can\\'t we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?  Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny\\'s family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.  Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"Yeah, yeah, we do!\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Yeah, that\\'s right.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"We do!\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"All right boys, show us what you\\'ve brought. \\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin\\' Marvin. \\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show \\'em Starvin\\' Marvin. \\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"No, Starvin\\' Marvin, that\\'s Kenny\\'s creamed corn.  No Starvin\\' Marvin, that\\'s a bad Starvin\\' Marvin!\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"The sports watch from the commercial?\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Yeah, that one.\\n\"\\n1,8,Bebe,\"I want a Starvin\\' Marvin.\\n\"\\n1,8,Clyde,\"Me too.\\n\"\\n1,8,Pip,\"Yes, I\\'ll pay fifty dollars for one.\\n\"\\n1,8,Class,\"Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mr. Garrison,\"Boys, you\\'re too young to take care of a child! I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Ah, I told you we shouldn\\'t have brought him to school dude.\\n\"\\n1,8,Principal Victoria,\"Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you\\'ve learned your lesson.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"No.\\n\"\\n1,8,Principal Victoria,\"You can\\'t care for this child!\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.\\n\"\\n1,8,Principal Victoria,\"Yes, but you don\\'t actually get involved with the child\\'s life. You\\'re supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn\\'t grow up in a normal place like South Park.\\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"So why can\\'t he live here now?\\n\"\\n1,8,Principal Victoria,\"Because he can\\'t!\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Because why?\\n\"\\n1,8,Principal Victoria,\"Because eight-year olds can\\'t be parents!\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Then you take care of him.\\n\"\\n1,8,Principal Victoria,\"I can\\'t, I, umm...I\\'m very busy.  I send my five dollars a month, see? \\n\"\\n1,8,Stan,\"This sucks, Starvin\\' Marvin is our friend.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Oh well, back to the poor country with you.\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.\\n\"\\n1,8,Chef,\"Yeah, well, let\\'s get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.\\n\"\\n1,8,Chef,\"Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave\\'s private parts.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Oh, whoops.  Now tell me what you see.\\n\"\\n1,8,Chef,\"Well, I\\'m no biologist, but I\\'d say it looks like turkey DNA.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Precisely, but look how rapidly it\\'s dividing.\\n\"\\n1,8,Chef,\"What does it mean?\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don\\'t destroy them all, they\\'ll take over the town. Maybe the world.\\n\"\\n1,8,Chef,\"Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"Sure. \\n\"\\n1,8,Agent 1,\"Hello there little boy, we\\'re looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Hey, hey, what\\'s going on?!

The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"POVVVV?\\n\"\\n1,8,Aide,\"Poverty stricken citizen.\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"Ohhoho, brilliant.  Daah!! What the hell is this!! \\n\"\\n1,8,Aide,\"I don\\'t know mayor, I don\\'t think it\\'s listed on the program.\\n\"\\n1,8,Mephesto,\"They\\'re increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.\\n\"\\n1,8,Chef,\"It\\'s a, Ih-ihit\\'s true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won\\'t get away with this, you bastards!\\n\"\\n1,8,Kyle,\"Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!\\n\"\\n1,8,The Mayor,\"OKAY PEOPLE, DON\\'T PANIC!

These children desperately need your support.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!\\n\"\\n1,8,Sally Struthers,\"So please, call and adopt a child today.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"I\\'m seriously getting pissed off over here!!\\n\"\\n1,8,Liane,\"You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?\\n\"\\n1,8,Marvin,\"Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof.\\n\"\\n1,8,Liane,\"Okay.\\n\"\\n1,8,Marvin,\"Sweet.\\n\"\\n1,8,Cartman,\"Eh, This is serious bullshit!

Let\\'s sing and dance and bake cookies\"\" \\n\"\\n1,9,Stan,\"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.\\n\"\\n1,9,Kyle,\"I\\'m a Jew\\nA lonely Jew...\\n\"\\n1,9,Mr. Hankey,\"Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!\\n\"\\n1,9,Kyle,\"Oh no, I\\'m not sane yet!\\n\"\\n1,9,Mr. Hankey,\"I brought some friends with me.\\n\"\\n1,9,Kyle,\"Friends? \\n\"\\n1,9,Townsfolk,\"Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!\\n\"\\n1,9,Kyle,\"You mean you can see him?

Why don\\'t you take your seat, Damien? We\\'re gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.  Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...\\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?\\n\"\\n1,10,Damien,\"Here begins the rule of pain!

The plague of night is upon ye.\\n\"\\n1,10,Mr. Garrison,\"Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? \\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says \\'Green Mega Man\\'?\\n\"\\n1,10,Kyle,\"Yeah. Mine says \\'Red Mega Man\\'.\\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Right. That\\'s what your supposed to get for my birthday.\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Dude. You\\'re not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.\\n\"\\n1,10,Kyle,\"Yeah, that\\'s weak!\\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Look, it\\'s very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn\\'t work, see?\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Up yours. Cartman. I\\'ll get you whatever the hell I want. \\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Oooh. So maybe you don\\'t want to have any of my mon\\'s cake, pie, and ice cream, then.\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. \\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That\\'s because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. \\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Heeyy, what do you think you\\'re doing, new kid?\\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Yeah. You can\\'t sit with us, weirdo!\\n\"\\n1,10,Damien,\"Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!\\n\"\\n1,10,Kyle,\"You can\\'t sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! \\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!\\n\"\\n1,10,Pip,\"Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.\\n\"\\n1,10,Damien,\"Then I will call you Pip.\\n\"\\n1,10,Pip,\"Right-o.\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she\\'s a real dog.\\n\"\\n1,10,Kenny,\"(Yeah, I feel that she\\'s a freakin\\' bitch!)\\n\"\\n1,10,Damien,\"That does it!

He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"A what?\\n\"\\n1,10,Kenny,\"Quack-quack.\\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Eeyy!

Here, let me sing you a little song:\\nWe\\'re all special in our own way\\nEverybody\\'s different, but that\\'s okay\\n\\'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin\\nDifferent points of view, be tall or thin\\nIt doesn\\'t mean I can\\'t lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin\\nWith my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been\\nRub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...\\nWhat were we talking about again?\\n\"\\n1,10,Kyle,\"The new kid.\\n\"\\n1,10,Damien,\"Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all! \\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Whoa!\\n\"\\n1,10,Chef,\"Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! \\n\"\\n1,10,Kyle,\"We told you, dude. \\n\"\\n1,10,Chef,\"We\\'ve got to do something, children! \\n\"\\n1,10,Damien,\"Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus! \\n\"\\n1,10,\"Stan, Kyle\",\"Jesus?\\n\"\\n1,10,Roland,\"Two minutes to air, Jesus.\\n\"\\n1,10,Jesus,\"Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. \\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Jesus, Jesus!\\n\"\\n1,10,Jesus,\"Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"Nono. There\\'s a big problem at school.

That\\'s pretty heavy.\\n\"\\n1,10,Stan,\"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming.

Huduh now he\\'s talking like the new kid.\\n\"\\n1,10,Jesus,\"Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.\\n\"\\n1,10,Kyle,\"... K.\\n\"\\n1,10,Groundskeeper,\"Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!\\n\"\\n1,10,Cartman,\"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I\\'m changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus.

That\\'s it! That\\'s the nose I want!\\n\"\\n1,11,Tom,\"Alright-y then.  Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you\\'re forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.\\n\"\\n1,11,Mr. Garrison,\"I can live with that.\\n\"\\n1,11,Tom,\"Alrighty then, let\\'s get started! \\n\"\\n1,11,Cartman,\"She wasn\\'t looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!\\n\"\\n1,11,Kyle,\"Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!\\n\"\\n1,11,Stan,\"You guy can stop fighting.

I\\'m quitting my job as a teacher. \\n\"\\n1,11,Wendy,\"Wwhat?\\n\"\\n1,11,Mr. Garrison,\"It\\'s strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I\\'ve decided to quit teaching, and do what I\\'ve always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.\\n\"\\n1,11,Wendy,\"You...you can\\'t.\\n\"\\n1,11,Mr. Garrison,\"But the good news is,  I\\'ve already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher. \\n\"\\n1,11,Class,\"Hooray! \\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Really?\\n\"\\n1,11,Principal Victoria,\"That\\'s right.

We\\'re only friends.\\n\"\\n1,11,Stan,\"But why?\\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Well first of all, you\\'re eight.\\n\"\\n1,11,Stan,\"It\\'s because I\\'m not a lesbian, isn\\'t it?\\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Oh boy.\\n\"\\n1,11,Wendy,\"It\\'s over. I give up. \\n\"\\n1,11,Mr. Garrison,\"Boy I\\'ll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.\\n\"\\n1,11,Mr. Hat,\"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. \\n\"\\n1,11,Mr. Garrison,\"What the...?  Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.  Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! \\n\"\\n1,11,Kyle,\"So how\\'d your date with Ms. Ellen go?\\n\"\\n1,11,Cartman,\"Did you make love?\\n\"\\n1,11,Stan,\"I think so.\\n\"\\n1,11,Cartman,\"No way!\\n\"\\n1,11,Stan,\"Yup.\\n\"\\n1,11,Kyle,\"Down by the fire?\\n\"\\n1,11,Stan,\"Yup.\\n\"\\n1,11,Kenny,\"(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)\\n\"\\n1,11,Stan,\"Did I what?\\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Good morning, children.\\n\"\\n1,11,Wendy,\"Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?\\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Sure, but...can\\'t it wait until after class, Wendy?\\n\"\\n1,11,Wendy,\"No. I just have to apologize for the way I\\'ve been acting.\\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Oh, that\\'s okay, Wendy.\\n\"\\n1,11,Wendy,\"No, it\\'s not. Since you\\'re here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.\\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Well, I would love that, Wendy.\\n\"\\n1,11,Wendy,\"And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,  and I\\'ve learned from it.  I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.\\n\"\\n1,11,Ms. Ellen,\"Wendy, there\\'s nothing between me and Stan!\\n\"\\n1,11,Cartman,\"That\\'s not what we just heard!\\n\"\\n1,11,Mr. Garrison,\"Hoh Mr. Hat, I hate this!

Testaburger! \\n\"\\n1,12,Anthropologist,\"...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth\\'s crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Boooriing. \\n\"\\n1,12,Mr. Garrison,\"Eric, keep quiet. I\\'m trying to sleep. \\n\"\\n1,12,Anthropologist,\"Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here?\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"Isn\\'t that your job?\\n\"\\n1,12,Anthropologist,\"Well... yes, but I want to see if you\\'re learning anything.\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"Oooh.\\n\"\\n1,12,Anthropologist,\"Okay, I tell you what. Why don\\'t we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads. \\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Day is never finished, Massa got me working\\nSomeday Massa set me free...\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"Dude. Shut up, Cartman.\\n\"\\n1,12,Pip,\"Oh! Oh I think I found one! \\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"No, I found it.\\n\"\\n1,12,Pip,\"Oh.

First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.\\n\"\\n1,12,Pip,\"Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Okay, ready? I\\'ll go first. \\n\"\\n1,12,Pip,\"Well-uh I, I guess you win.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Huh I don\\'t care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don\\'t want it. \\nDay is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! \\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"Whoa.

Why, this is Anasazi writing! My God, this must be thousands of years old!\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! \\n\"\\n1,12,Anchor,\"...and finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadraplegic Swiss man on a pony.\\n\"\\n1,12,Quadraplegic Swiss man,\"Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object.\\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, \\'dude, I found this triangle\\' and my friends were like, \\'dude\\' and I was all like \\'dude.\\'\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"...and I told him. I said, \\'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.\\' But he didn\\'t give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!\\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"You liar, Cartman!\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Screw you, triangle thief!\\n\"\\n1,12,Quadraplegic Swiss man,\"And so, the little boy will take his discovery home and perhaps donate it to science... mwell a little later. Back to you, Dave.\\n\"\\n1,12,Dave,\"Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he\\'s a little tubby.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Eeyy!\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"What are you going to do with it, dude?\\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"I\\'m going to put it in my room, where Cartman can\\'t find it.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Oh I\\'ll find it, don\\'t worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"You did throw it away, Cartman.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"I was just setting it aside.\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"Well, you might as well let it go.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Never! I\\'ll get that triangle if it\\'s the last thing I do!\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Give me a little bit of that pepper\\nGive me a little bit of that salt\\nPut it in the skillet and cook it...\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Excuse me, sir...\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Can I help-ey, you\\'re that movie critic - guy on TV.\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Leonard Maltin, yes.\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Well, I\\'ll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert.

How\\'d you know?\\n\"\\n1,12,Barbra Streisand,\"Okay, now this is very important.

Then we must look for them elsewhere.\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Come on, man. What is this all about?\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now?\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Hmmm. \\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Nono! I mean, where would she be staying?\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Where?\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Uh I don\\'t know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Dammit man, where\\'s your car?!\\n\"\\n1,12,Barbra Streisand,\"He has it, Milo. That little bastard has the triangle.\\n\"\\n1,12,Milo,\"Are you sure?\\n\"\\n1,12,Barbra Streisand,\"I\\'m sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck!\\n\"\\n1,12,Milo,\"Then why don\\'t we go get it?\\n\"\\n1,12,Barbra Streisand,\"A cop showed up - he\\'s a clever one - I can\\'t blow everything now that I\\'m this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.  How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand! \\n\"\\n1,12,Ike,\"Cokeshen. \\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"Cartman?\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"You scared the crap out of me, Ike!\\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"What the hell are you doing?!\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"I\\'m trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I\\'m not talking to you.

You can tell Cartman that it\\'s my triangle!\\n\"\\n1,12,Ike,\"Cookeh monter\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Well, you can tell Kyle that he\\'s a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!\\n\"\\n1,12,Ike,\"Ahtoahtahneurah.\\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Huh?!\\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"If it\\'ll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.I got the triangle, I got the triangle, dee dun dee dun\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Then we\\'ve got to keep looking.\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain\\'t drivin\\' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Haven\\'t you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"More than a bitch! She\\'s a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman.\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the univese. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos.\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don\\'t need to know all this!  Forget I asked!\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl\\'s wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles.\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?\\n\"\\n1,12,Leonard Maltin,\"Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets ahold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!\\n\"\\n1,12,Chef,\"Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don\\'t know what the hell that means, but it doesn\\'t sound good.\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"Man, the bus sure is late.\\n\"\\n1,12,Cartman,\"Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.\\n\"\\n1,12,Kyle,\"Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.\\n\"\\n1,12,Barbra Streisand,\"Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?\\n\"\\n1,12,Stan,\"Fine.\\n\"\\n1,12,Barbra Streisand,\"That is great.
